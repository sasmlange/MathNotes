Lesson 4-1: Graphing Equations in Slope-Intercept Form
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Terms

Slope-Intercept Formula: :math:`y = mx + b`

m is the slope.

b is the y-intercept.

.. rubric:: Graph from a Slope-Intercept Formula formula

#. Put a point at the y-intercept
#. :math:`m= \frac{rise}{run}` so starting at the y-intercept, go how much the numerator is up and the how much the denominator is to the right. Plot a point there.
#. Connect the two lines.

.. rubric:: If the formula is not in slope-intercept form

All you have to do is to change it to slope-intercept form.

:math:`3x+2y=6` is the same as :math:`y=- \frac{3}{2}x+3`

.. tip:: 
    
    You can also just graph the original formula as it is already in standard form.

.. rubric:: If x is not present or could be removed

An equation for a horizontal line might look like this: :math:`y = 10` or like this :math:`10y = 0x + 7` or even like this :math:`y=67x-7x+6x-66x+8`.
